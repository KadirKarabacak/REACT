In this repository, I keep all my work done with "React" in bulk.

## ðŸ–Š What have I learned so far ?

- How to install and use **Create-React-App** [ In real projects always use **Vite** for better performance and comminity support, but for learning Create-React-App is still ok ].
- What is a **Component** and how could i declare it.
- What is **JSX** and how can i use.
- What is **conditional rendering** and how can i use [ **Ternary Operator**, **Short Circuiting** ].
- How to render multiple components at once using loops. [ .map() forexample ]
- What is **props** and how can i use [ For DRY prensiple immediately **destructure** props object ].
- Why props are immutable.
- What is useState() and how to use it.
- What is **React fragment** and how can i use [ Instead of element blocks like "Div" simply use <> and </> ].
- What is the difference between **Imperetive** and **Declarative**. [ Vanilla JS vs React ]
- What are React frameworks. **[ NextJS, Remix ]**
- Why does React use one-way data flow. [ Also Angular has two-way data flow. ]
- What is **SSR [ Server-Side Rendering ]**, **CSR [ Client-Side Rendering ]** and **SPA [ Single-Page Application ]**.
