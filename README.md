In this repository, I keep all my work done with "React" in bulk.

## üñä What have I learned so far ?

#### ‚öí Setup

- How to install and use **Create-React-App** [ In real projects always use **Vite <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Vitejs-logo.svg/410px-Vitejs-logo.svg.png" style="width: 25px">** for better performance and comminity support, but for learning Create-React-App is still ok ].

#### üíª Rendering

- What is a **Component** and how could i declare it.
- What is **JSX** and how can i use.
- What is **conditional rendering** and how can i use [ **Ternary Operator**, **Short Circuiting** ].
- How to render multiple components at once using loops. [ .map() forexample ]
- What is **React fragment** and how can i use [ Instead of element blocks like "Div" simply use <> and </> ].

#### ‚Ñπ Props

- What is **props** and how can i use [ For DRY prensiple immediately **destructure** props object ].
- Why props are **immutable** [ Readonly ].
- What is children props, and how can i use them.

#### ‚ô¶ State

- What is **useState()** and how to use it.
- Why should i use a **callback function** into useState setter function.
- What is **React Hooks** and how to use them. [ Forexample useState, useReducer, useEffect ]
- One component has one state and isolated from other components.
- What is **Controlled Elements**, why and how i gonna use them. [ When working with forms ]
- What is State Management **[ Deciding when to create state, types of state and how data flows through the App]**
- When should i derive a state and where should i place it. **[ Local or Global State ]**
- What is **State Lifting** and when should i use it.
- Whats the difference between **Local and Global** state, and why i need to always start with **Local State**

#### üñä Information

- What is the difference between **Imperetive** and **Declarative**. [ Vanilla JS vs React ]
- What are React frameworks. **[ NextJS, Remix ]**
- Why does React use **one-way** data flow. [ Also Angular has **two-way** data flow. ]
- What is **SSR [ Server-Side Rendering ]**, **CSR [ Client-Side Rendering ]** and **SPA [ Single-Page Application ]**.
- What is **React Dev Tools** and how can i use.
- What is the **Thinking in React** [ Break UI into components, component tree, build static version (without state), think about state and establish data flow. ]
- What is **Redux** and when i need to use it. [ Global State Management ]
- Why should I organize my files into one file for each component. [ To avoid a big mess ]
