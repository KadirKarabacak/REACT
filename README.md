In this repository, I keep all my work done with "React" in bulk.

## ðŸ–Š What have I learned so far ?
* How to install and use **Create-React-App** [ In real projects always use **Vite** for better performance and comminity support, but for learning Create-React-App is still ok ].
* What is **JSX** and how can i use.
* What is **conditional rendering** and how can i use [ **Ternary Operator**, **Short Circuiting** ].
* What is **props** and how can i use [ For DRY prensiple immediately **destructure** props object ].
* What is **React fragment** and how can i use [ Instead of element blocks like "Div" simply use <> and </> ].
