# WorldWise Project with React + Vite

In this project first time i am using Vite and also React Router which is very useful to create Single Page Applications.

### Styling

- For styling i am using CSS Modules and some external CSS file which has no classes. Simply element styling.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
